abstract = {A stable numerical integration scheme is applied to the non‐divergent barotropic vorticity equation. Integrations are performed with time steps ranging from 15 min to 4 h. The root‐mean‐square differences between the forecasts are calculated in order to measure the sensitivity of the predictions to the size of the time step. These experiments show that the truncation errors remain reasonably small with time steps as large as two hours. This scheme is then associated with the semi‐implicit algorithm in the integration of the shallow water equations. Integrations are carried out with large time steps and the resulting predictions are presented in order to demonstrate that the scheme is perfectly stable. {\textcopyright} Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Recently, it has been demonstrated that the semi-implicit semi-Lagrangian technique can be successfully coupled with a three-time-level spectral discretization of the barotropic shallow-water equations. This permits the use of time steps that are much larger than those permitted by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) stability criterion for the corresponding Eulerian model, without loss of accuracy. In this paper we show that it is possible to further quadruple the efficiency of semi-implicit semi-Lagrangian spectral models beyond that already demonstrated. A doubling of efficiency accrues from the use of the stable and accurate two-time-level scheme described herein. For semi-implicit semi-Lagrangian spectral models a further doubling of efficiency can be achieved by using a smaller computational Gaussian grid than the usual one, without incurring the significant loss of stability and accuracy that is observed for the corresponding Eulerian spectral model in analogous circumstances.},

abstract = {First of all it is confirmed that even in these global runs with full physical parameterizations the sensitivity to the conversion from an Eulerian to a semi-Lagrangian formulation is acceptably small. In time truncation error tests with a T79 horizontal resolution it is found that, on average and with full physics, 30 min is about the upper limit for the time step based on acceptable time truncation errors. Since the Courant-Freidrichs-Lewy limit for the corresponding Eulerian model is about 10 min and the overhead of the semi-Lagrangian calculations is less than 30{\%} per time step, there is a significant gain in efficiency by using the optimized semi-Lagrangian formulation. Results are also presented showing the improvement in the accuracy of the 5-day forecasts obtained by raising the model top and by increasing the horizontal resolution. -from Authors},

abstract = {The treatment of advection is related to the stability, accuracy and efficiency of models used in numerical weather prediction. In order to remain stable, conventional Eulerian advection schemes must respect a Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) criterion, which limits the size of the time step that can be used in conjunction with a given spatial resolution. In recent years, tests with gridpoint models have shown that semi-Lagrangian schemes permit the use of large time steps (roughly three to six times those permitted by the CFL criterion for the corresponding Eulerian models), without reducing the accuracy of the forecasts. This leads to improved model efficiency, since fewer steps are needed to complete the forecast. Can similar results be achieved in spectral models? This paper examines the semi-Lagrangian treatment of advection on the Gaussian grid used in spectral models. Interpolating and noninterpolating versions of the semi-Lagrangian scheme are applied to the problem of solid body rotation on the globe, and their performance is compared with that of an Eulerian spectral treatment. It is shown that the semi-Lagrangian models produce stable, accurate integrations using time steps that far exceed the CFL limit for the Eulerian spectral model.},

Novel aspects include the application of the semi-Lagrangian scheme to a global model using the ECMWF hybrid coordinate in the vertical and its use in a baroclinic spectral model in conjunction with a reduced Gaussian grid in the horizontal. The former Eulerian vorticity-divergence formulation is first converted into a momentum-equation formulation that is considerably more economical, thanks in part to the incorporation of Legendre transform efficiencies that were previously demonstrated for the shallow-water equations. The semi-Lagrangian formulation is presented in detail, together with a discussion of computational aspects that are relevant for executing the high-resolution model efficiently on a modestly parallel supercomputer. The impact of formulation changes is assessed via numerical experiments on a set of 12 independent cases. In particular it is shown t...},

@article{Peixoto2018SLEXP,
abstract = {In this paper we propose a novel way to integrate time-evolving partial differential equations that contain nonlinear advection and stiff linear operators, combining exponential integration techniques and semi-Lagrangian methods. The general formulation is built from the solution of an integration factor problem with respect to the problem written with a material derivative so that the exponential integration scheme naturally incorporates the nonlinear advection. Semi-Lagrangian techniques are used to treat the dependence of the exponential integrator on the flow trajectories. The formulation is general, as many exponential integration techniques could be combined with different semi-Lagrangian methods. This formulation allows an accurate solution of the linear stiff operator, a property inherited by the exponential integration technique. It also provides an accurate representation of the nonlinear advection, even with large time step sizes, a property inherited by the semi-Lagrangian method. Aiming for application in weather and climate modelling, we discuss possible combinations of well established exponential integration techniques and state-of-the-art semi-Lagrangian methods used operationally in the application. We show experiments for the planar rotating shallow water equations revealing that traditional exponential integration techniques could benefit from this formulation with semi-Lagrangian to ensure stable integration with larger time step sizes. From the application perspective, which already uses semi-Lagrangian methods, the exponential treatment could improve the solution of wave-dispersion when compared to semi-implicit schemes.},
