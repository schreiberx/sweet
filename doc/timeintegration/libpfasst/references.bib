	abstract = {For the numerical solution of time-dependent partial differential equations, time-parallel methods have recently shown to provide a promising way to extend prevailing strong-scaling limits of numerical codes. One of the most complex methods in this ﬁeld is the “Parallel Full Approximation Scheme in Space and Time” (PFASST). PFASST already shows promising results for many use cases and many more is work in progress. However, a solid and reliable mathematical foundation is still missing. We show that under certain assumptions the PFASST algorithm can be conveniently and rigorously described as a multigridin-time method. Following this equivalence, ﬁrst steps towards a comprehensive analysis of PFASST using block-wise local Fourier analysis are taken. The theoretical results are applied to examples of diffusive and advective type. Copyright c 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The spectral deferred correction (SDC) method is an iterative scheme for computing a higher-order collocation solution to an ODE by performing a series of correction sweeps using a low-order timestepping method. This paper examines a variation of SDC for the temporal integration of PDEs called multi-level spectral deferred corrections (MLSDC), where sweeps are performed on a hierarchy of levels and an FAS correction term, as in nonlinear multigrid methods, couples solutions on different levels. Three different strategies to reduce the computational cost of correction sweeps on the coarser levels are examined: reducing the degrees of freedom, reducing the order of the spatial discretization, and reducing the accuracy when solving linear systems arising in implicit temporal integration. Several numerical examples demonstrate the effect of multi-level coarsening on the convergence and cost of SDC integration. In particular, MLSDC can provide significant savings in compute time compared to SDC for a three-dimensional problem.},

We begin by converting the original ODE into the corresponding Picard equation and apply a deferred correction procedure in the integral formulation, driven by either the explicit or the implicit Euler marching scheme. The approach results in algorithms of essentially arbitrary order accuracy for both non-stiﬀ and stiﬀ problems; their performance is illustrated with several numerical examples. For nonstiﬀ problems, the stability behavior of the obtained explicit schemes is very satisfactory and algorithms with orders between 8 and 20 should be competitive with the best existing ones. In our preliminary experiments with stiﬀ problems, a simple adaptive implementation of the method demonstrates performance comparable to that of a stateof-the-art extrapolation code (at least, at moderate to high precision).},

	abstract = {Efficient time integration schemes are necessary to capture the complex processes involved in atmospheric flows over long periods of time. In this work, we propose a high-order, implicit-explicit numerical scheme that combines Multi-Level Spectral Deferred Corrections (MLSDC) and the Spherical Harmonics (SH) transform to solve the wave-propagation problems arising from the shallow-water equations on the rotating sphere. The iterative temporal integration is based on a sequence of corrections distributed on coupled space-time levels to perform a significant portion of the calculations on a coarse representation of the problem and hence to reduce the time-to-solution while preserving accuracy. In our scheme, referred to as MLSDC-SH, the spatial discretization plays a key role in the efficiency of MLSDC, since the SH basis allows for consistent transfer functions between space-time levels that preserve important physical properties of the solution. We study the performance of the MLSDC-SH scheme with shallow-water test cases commonly used in numerical atmospheric modeling. We use this suite of test cases, which gradually adds more complexity to the nonlinear system of governing partial differential equations, to perform a detailed analysis of the convergence rate of MLSDC-SH upon refinement in time. We illustrate the good stability properties of MLSDC-SH and show that the proposed scheme achieves up to eighth-order accuracy in time. Finally, we study the conditions in which MLSDC-SH achieves its theoretical speedup, and we show that it can significantly reduce the computational cost compared to single-level Spectral Deferred Corrections (SDC).},

The shallow water equations exhibit the major di culties associated with the horizontal dynamical aspects of atmospheric modeling on the spherical earth. These cases are designed for use in the evaluation of numerical methods proposed for climate modeling and to identify potential trade-o s which must always be made in numerical modeling. Before a proposed scheme is applied to a full baroclinic atmospheric model it should perform well on these problems in comparison with other currently accepted numerical methods. The cases are presented in order of complexity. They consist of advection across the poles, steady state geostrophically balanced  ow of both global and local scales, forced nonlinear advection of an isolated low, zonal  ow impinging on an isolated mountain, Rossby-Haurwitz waves and observed atmospheric states. One of the cases is also identi ed as a computer performance/algorithm e ciency benchmark for assessing the performance of algorithms adapted to massively parallel computers.},

It comes with many different, pre-implemented examples and has seven tutorials to help new users with their first steps. Time-parallelism is implemented either in an emulated way for debugging and prototyping as well as using MPI for benchmarking. The code is fully documented and tested using continuous integration, including most results of previous publications. Here, we describe the structure of the code by taking two different perspectives: the user's and the developer's perspective. While the first sheds light on the front-end, the examples and the tutorials, the second is used to describe the underlying implementation and the data structures. We show three different examples to highlight various aspects of the implementation, the capabilities and the usage of pySDC. Also, couplings to the FEniCS framework and PETSc, the latter including spatial parallelism with MPI, are described.},

But when parallelization in space saturates, the time direction offers itself as a further direction for parallelization. The time direction is however special, and for evolution problems there is a causality principle: the solution later in time is affected (it is even determined) by the solution earlier in time, but not the other way round. Algorithms trying to use the time direction for parallelization must therefore be special, and take this very different property of the time dimension into account.},

	abstract = {The spectral deferred correction (SDC) method is class of iterative solvers for ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It can be interpreted as a preconditioned Picard iteration for the collocation problem. The convergence of this method is well-known, for suitable problems it gains one order per iteration up to the order of the quadrature method of the collocation problem provided. This appealing feature enables an easy creation of flexible, high-order accurate methods for ODEs. A variation of SDC are multi-level spectral deferred corrections (MLSDC). Here, iterations are performed on a hierarchy of levels and an FAS correction term, as in nonlinear multigrid methods, couples solutions on different levels. While there are several numerical examples which show its capabilities and efficiency, a theoretical convergence proof is still missing. This paper addresses this issue. A proof of the convergence of MLSDC, including the determination of the convergence rate in the time-step size, will be given and the results of the theoretical analysis will be numerically demonstrated. It turns out that there are restrictions for the advantages of this method over SDC regarding the convergence rate.},
