--> _87_10_program_swe_sphere_parareal
    :: TODO

--> _87_20_program_swe_sphere_xbraid_parareal_vs_mgrit
    :: Compare Parareal and two-level MGRIT with nrelax = 0
    :: Results should be equal
    :: TODO

--//-- 
-- The following tests follow Section 3.6.2. "Debugging XBraid" from XBraid developer manual
-- In the last test, we also compare offline and online computed errors
--//--

--> 87_20_program_swe_sphere_xbraid_wrapped_functions
    :: Test user-defined XBraid wrapped functions

--> 87_20_program_swe_sphere_xbraid_one_level
    :: One-level MGRIT wit N processors;
    :: Solution should be identical to the serial one

--> 87_20_program_swe_sphere_xbraid_residuals
    :: Two-level MGRIT with tol = 0., max_iter = 3, use_seqsoln = 1, N processors
    :: Residuals should be zero at each iteration

--> 87_20_program_swe_sphere_xbraid_residuals2
    :: print_level = 3 to check residual norms at each C-point
    :: Residuals should be zero for two C-points per iteration

--> 87_20_program_swe_sphere_xbraid_multilevel
    :: Multilevel MGRIT tests with N processors
    :: Verify if XBraid solution is within tol w.r.t. serial solution
